- name: Beethoven Project
  descr: "I participated in a competition at my university when I was a junior in the Software Engineering department. I created a project that makes pianos easily accessible to families who don't have the opportunity to experience music, especially pianos, regularly. By connecting Arduino and smartphones, I developed a piano that anyone can easily access and play. Eventually, I won first place in the Software Engineering department and fifth place overall in the university competition. It was a very rewarding experience."

  descr: "During my senior year in college, while taking an RDMA Database course, I embarked on a project to design RDMA. Throughout the design process, we contacted and interviewed actual equipment manufacturing companies. We divided the project into Logical Data Models and Physical Data Models, ensuring that our design was practical and could be seamlessly implemented by the manufacturing companies. The project was completed with great success, yielding impressive results."
